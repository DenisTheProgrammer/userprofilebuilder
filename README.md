# SwingCodeSamples

# : Introduction to Swing 

This is sample code relevant to lecture _Swing API Introduction - Components, Containers and Layouts_ [CI5105 lecture TB2week1]() It is in a NetBeans project called 'SwingCodeSamplesNB' . 

To use this code you should clone this project and run the sample code as covered in (Using KUGitlab - Access and Workflow)[https://kingstonuniversity.sharepoint.com/:p:/s/CI5105Privatemst/EXORk0ko9Y5EiZaPDW8x0vcBQ4ltw2hfrlRG3kj9UimQSg?e=6lyeEW] 

To get this sample code onto your local machine you will need to:

- [ ]  [Create a project access token ](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html#personal-access-tokens). This will be used to allow you to authenticate to GitLab.com/KUGitlab for the purposes of typical operations e.g. cloning and pushing to private repositories in your sub-group.  You will typically only need on e personal access token but you can create a new one whenever you require it and delete old ones. 
-[] Optionally Import the Project into your Portfolio Namespace - for 'Self-imported Repository' if it hasn't been 'Pre-imported'. Check if the Repository is already in your Namespace 
- [ ]  [Clone this new Repository using your Personal Access Token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/start-using-git.html#clone-using-a-token). You can do this from an IDE (e.g. NetBeans) or from the command-line (e.g. Git Bash) 
- [ ] Use a Git development process (add, commit, push) to version manage your code.  This will be covered in the module but is [typically](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/add-file.html). Currently your Portfolio Sub-Group has not been set-up and so you will not be able to push back your changes. You don't have the permission to do this to the origin repository - or else these changes would change the sample code for everyone else!
